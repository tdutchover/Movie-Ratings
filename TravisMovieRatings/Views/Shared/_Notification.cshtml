@*
This view displays only one message at a time to the user. To display a message,
it must be stored in TempData by a controller action method.

TempData is used here because it can maintain data across HTTP requests, which is necessary
for passing messages between redirects. This persistence across requests is crucial when an
AJAX call triggers a controller action method that subsequently results in a redirect.

ViewBag is unsuitable for this scenario as it only transfers data from the controller to the
view within a single request, and doesn't maintain data across redirects or multiple requests.
