# Movie Reviews

## üìã Overview
Movie Reviews is a demo web application designed for a single user to track their personal written movie reviews and ratings, which range from 1 to 10. I created this application based on my long-standing enjoyment of keeping personal movie reviews.

The application also allows users to add and review video games in the same way.

Further enhancements are planned.

## üñ•Ô∏è User Interface Pages

### Gallery Page
Displays all movies in the user‚Äôs personal movie collection and allows filtering by genre, rating, or a combination of both.

Click a movie image to navigate to the corresponding [Movie Details Page](#movie-details-page).

  - Displays a link to the [Add Movie Page](#add-movie-page)
  - Shows a table of all movies in the user's personal movie collection.
    - The table supports multi-page navigation and sorting by column.
    - The table includes a search function to find movies by title within the personal collection.
    - The table provides access to the [Edit Review Page](#edit-review-page), [Movie Details Page](#movie-details-page), and the option to [delete](#delete-confirmation-dialog) a movie and its review.

### Add Movie Page
Allows users to add new movies to their personal collection by selecting a movie, entering a rating, and optionally providing a written review.

  - Enables users to search for movies by title and select a movie to write a review.
    - Movies dynamically display as the user types each character of the title.
    - The user selects a movie by clicking its image.
  - **Feature Implementation:**
    - **Third-Party API Integration:** Retrieves movie data from a third-party public movie database API.
    - **Automatic Genre Addition:** When a user adds a new movie, the application checks if any of the movie‚Äôs genres are missing from the local SQL Server database. If new genres are found, they are automatically added to ensure all genres can be used as search filters on the [Gallery Page](#gallery-page).
